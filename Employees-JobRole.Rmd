## Treemap showing which Job Roles have the most Employees

Fun little chart that provides a quick overview of the largest concentration of Employees by Job Role:

```{r}

library(tree)

role.amount <- df %>% select(JobRole) %>% group_by(JobRole) %>% summarize(amount=n()) %>%
ggplot(aes(area=amount, fill=JobRole, label=JobRole)) +  geom_treemap() +
  geom_treemap_text(grow = T, reflow = T, colour = "black") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Major Job Roles Inside the Organization",
    caption = "The area of each tile represents the number of
employees by type of job role.",
    fill = "JobRole")

role.amount
```
